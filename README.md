# Steph-s-REACT-Portfolio


In this assignment, I was tasked with creating a REACT Portfolio. This is a portfolio that was created using REACT. Using components, there is a Contact, About, and Work Section. There is also a contact form that allows you to contact me. Some issues I had with this progrmam were with styling. I had lots of issues with styling and things not fitting.
