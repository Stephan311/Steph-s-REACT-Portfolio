    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    My Mission is to help businesses and organizations reach the next level through website design/development and digital marketing solutions tailored to their specific needs. 
    I started my company; Motion Media in Janruary 2020, along with my 2 partners, with the goal of changing the way the business world sees marketing.
    Growing up, I always had a passion for business, creatives, and entrepreneurship. I needed a way to pursue these interests, in came Motion Media CA.
    Marketing is often looked at as an expense. Well, we know that marketing should NEVER be an expense. If marketing is an expense for your business or organization (or you don't have any marketing at all), you are missing out on a huge opportunity. We are here to fix that. The same goes with websites.
    Time after time, we continue to see businesses fall and disappear because they have not adopted to the digital era when it comes to marketing.             
    With this mindset, we offer all of our clients a 100% refund if our products and services did not produce them results that are greater than what they paid us for.      
    We take pride in giving our clients the ability to invest money into marketing or a website witout a fear or worry that it won't work, because if it doesn't work, that money goes right back to them.
